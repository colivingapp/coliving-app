            <p>Coliving App is an open-source, community-driven platform redefining how we live, connect, and build shared homes around the world.</p>

            <p>The project was born from a real experience of living and sharing a home in Medellin, Colombia in 2019 with amazing people from around the world — an unforgettable glimpse into what community life could truly be. That spirit of connection sparked the idea, and after a long journey of reflection and development, the first public beta was launched in 2024.</p>

            <p>Coliving App is more than just a tool for finding spaces — it’s a growing movement toward a new way of living. We believe that shared homes can be vibrant communities, places where friendships grow, projects are born, and daily life feels lighter and richer.</p>

            <p>Whether you want to launch a new coliving space, join an existing one, or find like-minded housemates, Coliving App gives you the freedom, tools, and support to make it happen.</p>

            <p>Coliving App is not just a platform — it's an experiment in how we live, share, and create meaning together. Whether you’re a digital nomad, a remote worker, a city explorer, or a community builder, you’re invited to help shape the future of shared living.</p>

            <p>This is our first public beta release — a work in progress shaped by early adopters like you. Thank you for being part of the journey.</p>
