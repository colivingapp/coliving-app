## üõ†Ô∏è Local Setup

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/colivingapp/coliving-app.git
   cd coliving-app
   composer install
   npm install
   ```  
2. Create a virtual host (e.g. http://ca.local) pointing to the Laravel project's /public directory.

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, and set at least the following:
   ```
   APP_URL=http://ca.local
   DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
   ```
4. In `vite.config.js`, update the server.origin to match your local URL:
   ```
   server: {
      origin: 'http://ca.local'
   }
   ```
5. Run setup commands:  
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   php artisan key:generate
   php artisan storage:link
   npm run watch
   ```
6. Visit `http://ca.local` in your browser and sign up with your desired email. The first user is auto-verified and becomes the owner of the example coliving space. Configure your email server credentials in `.env` to enable full functionality.
